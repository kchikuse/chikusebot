    <strong>FEBRUARY 2018</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    February 6, 2018:&nbsp; When your peace is disturbed by circumstances, look to
    Me.&nbsp; I will lead you in the way of tranquility.&nbsp; Even though your soul
    is in turmoil, I am with you to calm your storm.&nbsp; I will bring you into
    quiet rest and establish you in a place of peace.&nbsp; Be still and
    deliberately seek My face as you yield to the work that I am doing in you right
    now.&nbsp; <em>Psalm 46:10 Be still, and know that I am God.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    February 5, 2018:&nbsp; Gather your strength and allow only those things that
    require your attention to draw from that strength.&nbsp; This is still a time
    when you must simplify in order to fortify your life experience.&nbsp; Keep in
    mind that I am the source of your strength and the power of your purpose, says
    the Lord.&nbsp; I will impart to you a supernatural ability to discern and see
    with clarity as you make choices at this time.&nbsp; <em>Psalm 18:2 The Lord is
    my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will
    trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</em></p>

I am extricating you from things that have kept you bound and have kept you from
personal intimate relationship with Me, says the Lord.&nbsp; Be sensitive to things
that draw your attention away to fleshly endeavors and away from seeking My
face.&nbsp; Position yourself by prioritizing your time and energy in ways that will
bring glory to My kingdom.&nbsp; I will give you the strength and direction to make
the necessary changes that will lead to purity and righteousness.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Philippians
    2:13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good
    pleasure.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    February 2, 2018:&nbsp; Beloved, when things get rocky and cause you to feel
    unstable, remember that I am your place of stability and security.&nbsp; Look to
    Me for comfort and safety in these changing times.&nbsp; I will help you
    regroup.&nbsp; You will be able to move forward with confidence in the fact that
    I will lead you in the way you should go so that you do not falter, says the
    Lord.&nbsp; <em>Psalm 32:8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you
    should go; I will guide you with My eye.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    February 1, 2018:&nbsp; Do not allow your faith to be shaken by adverse
    conditions and circumstances.&nbsp; Stand strong in what you know to be truth.&nbsp;
    I am with you and for you.&nbsp; You are precious in My sight, says the Lord.&nbsp;
    Let me bring restoration and healing to your soul.&nbsp; Let Me raise you up in
    strength and power.&nbsp; I am your very present help in times of trouble.&nbsp;
    <em>Psalms 27:5 For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In
        the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a
        rock.<br></em></p>
<p class="auto-style60">
    <strong>JANUARY 2018</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    January 31, 2018:&nbsp; Maintain your confidence in Me, says the Lord.&nbsp; The
    enemy would have you condemn yourself for falling short of self-imposed goals.&nbsp;
    But, this will only serve to get you out of the flow of the Spirit.&nbsp; You
    must repent--change your mind--and receive My forgiveness and then forgive
    yourself and begin again.&nbsp; Rise up and walk in the Spirit.&nbsp; <em>Romans
    8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who
    do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    January 30, 2018:&nbsp; Life's trouble offers teaching moments for you to see
    and learn.&nbsp; Difficult circumstances give opportunities to overcome and to
    grow spiritually.&nbsp; Nothing is wasted in My kingdom.&nbsp; Your choices in
    life produce results.&nbsp; What you must consider is whether or not you have
    faith in Me to bring you through to the optimum eternal outcome.&nbsp; I tell
    you honestly that you can trust Me, says the Lord.&nbsp; <em>Mark 11:22 So Jesus
    answered and said to them, &quot;Have faith in God.&quot;</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    January 29, 2018:&nbsp; Do not be drawn off course by focusing on Spirit
    manifestations.&nbsp; Evidence of My presence will be present when you seek to
    know Me.&nbsp; When you only look to find the demonstration and proof of My
    existence in the natural realm, you miss the true power of relationship with Me
    in your life, says the Lord.&nbsp; Set yourself to know Me.&nbsp; <em>1 John
    5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding,
    that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son
    Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style64">

Set your heart, your faith, and your will to receive all that I have promised.&nbsp;
All that I have made available through the plan of redemption is yours to have
for yourself.&nbsp; But, you must settle that issue in your own heart and to know
that My love and blessings are not just for a chosen few, but for all who
believe, says the Lord.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em class="auto-style56" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Acts
            10:34-35&nbsp; Then Peter opened his mouth and said: &quot;In truth I perceive that God
            shows no partiality.&nbsp; But in every nation whoever fears Him and works
            righteousness is accepted by Him.&quot;</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 26, 2018:&nbsp; Be alert and watch for doors to open that
        have been closed for some time.&nbsp; You can now move ahead in unexpected and
        surprising ways.&nbsp; Do not be afraid of getting off track.&nbsp; I am leading
        you in ways that will be greatly beneficial to you.&nbsp; Never forget that I am
        with you and for you, says the Lord.&nbsp; <em>Psalms 32:8 I will instruct you
            and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 25, 2018:&nbsp; In a vision I saw a man launch himself
        off a cliff with a paraglider.&nbsp; He seemed to be falling, presumably to his
        death, but then he caught a thermal and was lifted up to soar above the land.&nbsp;
        And, I heard the Lord say, &quot;Many of My people have launched themselves into
        things that seem to be failing, but I tell you honestly that I am with you to
        cause you to rise above failure into a position of victory.&quot;&nbsp; <em>1
            Corinthians 15:57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our
            Lord Jesus Christ.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 24, 2018:&nbsp; Stay calm when you are faced with
        difficult circumstances.&nbsp; You cannot be led by My Spirit unless you are
        quiet enough to be directed.&nbsp; Fear is the first sign that you are not
        connected to Me, says the Lord.&nbsp; It is imperative that you rise above
        emotional responses to a position of faith so that I can show you the way and
        direct your steps.&nbsp; Trust!&nbsp; <em>2 Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us
            a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 23, 2018:&nbsp; Do not allow complacency to interfere
        with the spiritual work being done in your life.&nbsp; I will bring conviction
        regarding issues where you must change your mind in order to get on the right
        track.&nbsp; Stubborn refusal to give up fleshly attitudes and motivations will
        result in your getting stuck spiritually.&nbsp; You cannot progress until you
        deal with these issues, says the Lord.&nbsp; Quiet your soul and allow Me to
        lead you forward.&nbsp; <em>Psalm 81:12 So I gave them over to their own
            stubborn heart, to walk in their own counsels.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 22, 2018:&nbsp; I am aware of your restlessness, which
        comes from the atmosphere being somewhat stagnant.&nbsp; Use this time to put
        down roots, to dig deep in search of divine mysteries.&nbsp; Come close to Me,
        says the Lord.&nbsp; Let Me speak to your heart and reveal spiritual truth.&nbsp;
        Let us have sweet communion.&nbsp; <em>2 Corinthians 13:14 The grace of the Lord
            Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with
            you all.</em></font></p>

I see My sheep scattered and unable to focus.&nbsp; Too many things to consider and
circumstances to deal with will spread you too thin and wear you out.&nbsp; Gather
yourself up, prioritize, and get focused on what really matters.&nbsp; Guard your
personal boundaries so that other people don't exploit or take advantage of your
time or energy.&nbsp; But you will also have to separate the legitimate draw on your
resources from the frivolous and unnecessary, says the Lord.&nbsp; Set a watch.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em class="auto-style56" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Nahum
            2:1 He who scatters has come up before your face. Man the fort! Watch the road!

<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 19, 2018:&nbsp; I speak to those who have been
        traumatized by the things you have endured, and I say to you that I am your
        Healer.&nbsp; Allow Me to bring comfort and to give you the strength to move
        beyond the pain.&nbsp; You will always remember what happened to you, but it
        will not always hurt.&nbsp; Set your mind and heart on rising above the things
        of the earth to walk and live in the Spirit, says the Lord.&nbsp; <em>Isaiah
            60:2 For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and deep darkness the
            people; but the Lord will arise over you, and His glory will be seen upon you.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 18, 2018:&nbsp; Take the time to delineate spiritual
        reality, and set yourself to stay in the light and truth.&nbsp; Be done with
        deception and darkness.&nbsp; If your desire is to be transformed into My image,
        you must forget about the past and focus on that which is spiritually relevant and eternal.&nbsp;
        Embrace all that is godly, says the Lord.&nbsp; <em>Romans 12:2 And do not be
            conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that
            you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 17, 2018:&nbsp; Many of you are on the absolute threshold
        of a greater understanding of My kingdom, which is necessary in developing a
        genuine relationship with Me, says the Lord.&nbsp; But, you must push past
        spiritual laziness that becomes an anchor to your soul that restricts curiosity.&nbsp;
        It will take desire and great effort to overcome complacency, but the end of
        that journey will be worth your time.&nbsp; <em>Proverbs 15:19 The way of the
            lazy man is like a hedge of thorns, but the way of the upright is a highway.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 16, 2018:&nbsp; While in the Spirit, I felt the rhythmic
        motion of being rocked by waves.&nbsp; Then, I could see that I was in a small
        boat on a body of water in the middle of a beautiful landscape.&nbsp; And, the
        Lord showed me that it was an example of being one with Him.&nbsp; I was one
        with the boat, the boat was one with the water, and the water was one with the
        landscape.&nbsp; The boat was a symbol of Jesus, the water was the Holy Spirit,
        and the landscape was God the Father.&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; <em>John 17:21 ...that
            they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may

        your heart, says the Lord, which will take you to new heights spiritually.&nbsp;
        It is time for you to progress beyond where you settled for less than is
        possible.&nbsp; Discouragement has taken a toll and at times has even paralyzed
        you.&nbsp; Now you must get up.&nbsp; Shake off your self-imposed limitations.&nbsp;
        Take the first step in becoming the best version of yourself that you can be.&nbsp;
        <em>Deuteronomy 1:21&nbsp; Look, the Lord your God has set the land before you;

you get at the root of every limitation, and isolate the foundation of the lie
that has created unbelief.&nbsp; This is most certainly a work of the enemy against
your soul to keep you from divine potential, says the Lord.&nbsp; Break out and break
forth!&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Philippians

    <font size="5">January 12, 2018:&nbsp; I am looking for those who will become
        true seekers in My kingdom.&nbsp; I am searching throughout the earth to see who
        desires to come into My presence.&nbsp; You have to take the first small step in
        My direction, and I will take a giant step to meet with you, says the Lord.&nbsp;
        You must believe that I exist and that I care for you.&nbsp; Then, you can come.
        <em>Matthew 7:7 &quot;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
            knock, and it will be opened to you.&quot;</em></font></p>

    <font size="5">January 11, 2018:&nbsp; I speak to those who cannot seem to break
        out of old cycles of existence.&nbsp; You are willing to move on, but you are
        also afraid to take the next step for fear of failure.&nbsp; This is a time when
        I will open doors of opportunity, but you cannot seek My face or hear My voice
        in your current condition.&nbsp; Fear involves torment, but it will take faith
        to proceed.&nbsp; It is impossible for you to live in faith and fear at the same
        time.&nbsp; You must choose, says the Lord.&nbsp; <em>2 Timothy 1:7 For God has
            not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 10, 2018:&nbsp; Beloved, it is My desire that you would
        reach a level of being habitually conscious of My Spirit.&nbsp; That is to walk
        and live in the Spirit and never deviate from being one with Me, says the Lord.&nbsp;
        This will take deliberate effort and determination in the beginning, but if you
        persist it will become as natural as breathing.&nbsp; <em>John 4:24 &quot;God is
            Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&quot;</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 9, 2018:&nbsp; I had a vision of Jacob's Ladder with
        angels ascending and descending.&nbsp; It was as though they were in a dance.&nbsp;
        There was a constant stream of those going up as they passed those coming down.&nbsp;
        It was a very graceful and&nbsp; beautiful flow.&nbsp; And, the Lord said, &quot;I
        want you to know that I send angels to minister to you in your times of need.&nbsp;
        You are not alone.&quot;&nbsp; <em>Psalm 91:9-11&nbsp; Because you have made the
            Lord, who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place, no evil shall
            befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; for He shall give His
            angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.</em></font></p>
<p class="auto-style64">
    <font size="5">January 8, 2018:&nbsp; Be at peace and insulate yourself from
        those who stir up strife and cause contention.&nbsp; You can only maintain
        genuine peace when you abide in Me, says the Lord.&nbsp; Keep the truth of My
        word close to your heart so that you can develop proper perspective and see with
        clarity, says the Lord.&nbsp;<em> </em></font><em><span class="auto-style56">Philippians

In much the same way that you would position yourself and do the work to receive
a promotion in the natural realm, it is My desire that you take your place
spiritually and do all that is necessary to receive the greatest benefits of My
kingdom, says the Lord.&nbsp; This positioning will take thought and deliberate
effort as well as strength of desire and purpose, but you will not regret it.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span class="auto-style56" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"><em>Jeremiah

    January 5, 2018:&nbsp; I am with you to guide you into My will and purpose for
    you.&nbsp; Do not be afraid.&nbsp; I will speak to you in ways that are easy for
    you to understand.&nbsp; And, I will direct you.&nbsp; However, you must
    position yourself to be sensitive to My Spirit.&nbsp; Spiritual awareness is
    developed as you spend time in My presence, says the Lord.&nbsp;

        30:21 Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &quot;This is the way, walk in

    January 4, 2018:&nbsp; Sometimes you forget about my grace.&nbsp; You have My
    full acceptance and favor when you belong to Me.&nbsp; And, I will help you and
    empower you to go through difficulties that arise.&nbsp; Rely on Me to guide you
    through the maze of confusion and bring you to a place of supernatural strength,
    says the Lord.&nbsp; You are precious to Me.&nbsp; <em class="auto-style145">2 </em>
    <em>Corinthians 12:9 And He said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for My
        strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast
        in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    January 3, 2018:&nbsp; Do not worry about what lies ahead.&nbsp; You have this
    moment today to make the most of your life.&nbsp; Stay present with Me, says the
    Lord.&nbsp; Refuse to lag behind by focusing on the past or what might have
    been.&nbsp; And, resist the temptation to project out into the future.&nbsp;
    Whatever you presume for the days ahead will not be what you think.&nbsp; Live
    in the truth of where you are now.&nbsp; <em>Matthew 6:34a Therefore do not
    worry about tomorrow.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    January 2, 2018:&nbsp; You have questions about how to proceed, and there are
    complexities involved in your decision-making process.&nbsp; However, I will
    give you wisdom and guidance if you ask.&nbsp; Ask in complete assurance that I
    will impart supernatural insights that will take you where you need to go, says
    the Lord.&nbsp; I hear and answer the prayer of faith.&nbsp;
    <em>James 1:5 If
        any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and
        without reproach, and it will be given to him.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style147">
    January 1, 2018:&nbsp; Simplicity is a place of strength.&nbsp; When things get
    too complicated you lose concentration, and you could even lose sight of
    purpose.&nbsp; Just get down to basics--the essence of who you are and what you
    must do to express yourself honestly, clearly and understandably.&nbsp; Refuse
    to allow things in your life to get too complex or tangled, says the Lord.&nbsp;
    <em>Psalm 51:10&nbsp; Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast
        spirit within me.</em></p>
